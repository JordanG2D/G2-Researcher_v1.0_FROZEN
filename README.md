- **Quantitative Analysis**
- **Line movement tracking**
- **Pattern recognition**
- **High-frequency hypothesis cycling**

This variant will become a **quant-heavy explorer**, optimized for:
- Statistical reasoning  
- Multi-run experiment batching  
- EV modeling foundations  

### Variant Direction
AGENT_B inherits the DEV improvements, then evolves toward:
- Faster reasoning  
- Superior numerical stability  
- Efficient multi-experiment loops  

### Notes
This is the engine that will help power the early quant workflows inside Black Box Lab.
